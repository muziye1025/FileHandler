1.The application should be run in linux.
2.Please use g++ to build the application, such as you can input "g++ readFile.cpp -o readFile -lpthread" in linux terminal.
2.The file's name, word which will be checked and processes number should be input by user.
   For example: ./readFile Gone_with_the_wind.txt caught 4, application is readFile, file name is Gone with the wind.txt, caught is the word, processes number is 4, both of the default and maximum value is 8.
3.The "mmapFile" and "shareMemory" will be automatically generated when the program runs, and they will be automatically deleted before the program exits, please donâ€™t worry.
4."Gone_with_the_wind.txt" is the test file which is used to debug the program, you can use your own file to test the program.
